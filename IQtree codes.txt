* Infer an ML tree and perform SH-aLRT test as well as ultrafast bootstrap with 1000 replicates:

  iqtree -s data.phy -m TEST -alrt 1000 -bb 1000

* IQ-TREE can perform the ultrafast bootstrap with partition models by e.g., 
iqtree-s example.phy-p example.nex-B 1000 

# for version 1.x change-p to-spp and-B to-bb


* with auto model selection
iqtree -s <input_file> -m MFP -bb 1000 -nt AUTO
